# EcoWatt
A web application to control a simulated smart-home, with an emphasis on sustainable behaviour.

This project was completed by 9 students from Heriot-Watt University, with students from the Edinburgh and Dubai campuses.

## Overview
The main aim of the system is to monitor energy generation and consumption and display the analyzed data.

The system is intended to mutually work with the "Esteem Smart home". The system records the energy generated, records and analyses energy consumed by smart devices and provides statistical information about the energy use.

It alerts the users if the energy consumption is high and provides suggestions for optimal energy use. It thus makes the user aware of their energy needs and incentivizes users to adapt to sustainable choices.

An account supports multiple 'Netflix-styled' profiles for different home-dwellers. This allows the application to provide in-depth information access to some users while restricting others.

## Installation
To host the EcoWatt application, you must first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on the server.

After installing Node.js, download the application source files featured on this repo.

After downloading the application source files, open the terminal and navigate to the application source folder and run:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary Node.js modules to host the application.
After this step, the server is now ready to host the application. Enter the following to start hosting:
```
npm start
```
## Screenshots
Below are a handful of screenshots of the application, showcasing the main pages and features of EcoWatt.
